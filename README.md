# WAVGEN
fairly configurable tone generator (outputs WAVE files)

* build it by running *build.cmd* on Windows or *build.sh* on other OS's
* modify the parameters inside *config.cfg*
* generate the tone(s) by simply running the binary
* check the status logs of the last time the program was run in *log.txt*
